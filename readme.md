# P3: Developer's Best Friend

## Live URL
<http://p3.skbcscie15.me>

## Description
A web application that allows visitors to generate fake data. The application allows for two forms of fake data, lorem ipsum text and fake users.

## Demo

## Details for teaching team
My submission is a few hours late due to some server configuration errors. All commits with the exception of the final readme commit were submitted prior to the deadline.
I troubleshot and needed to remove my live site after fixing server issues and then re-deploy. Everything is now functional.

## Outside
My app contains some the following two PHP packages:

Lorem Ipsum data: badcow/lorem-ipsum PHP package.
User data: fzaninotto/faker PHP package.
